# Securing the Perimeter Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Securing the Perimeter project. This project integrates the valuable skills and knowledge you have acquired throughout the course, focusing on enhancing perimeter network security.

## Project Scenario
XYZ is the premier cryptocurrency exchange, conducting over a billion trades daily. Despite being one of the most reliable and secure exchanges globally, XYZ has encountered challenges in scaling their security posture due to rapid growth. 

### Challenges Faced
The primary challenge lies in securing their Perimeter Network Security. The networking team has been overwhelmed by the rapid expansion, leading to the construction of an insecure network infrastructure. The consequences of these challenges include:
- Lack of visibility into network activities
- Improper access control setup

### The Breach
Due to these vulnerabilities, XYZ experienced a massive breach. The attackers compromised the network and internal servers, resulting in the theft of over 500 Bitcoin. 

### Objective
To address these critical issues, XYZ has contracted SecureCorp, a world-renowned cybersecurity consulting firm. Your role in this project is to:
- Redesign the network architecture to enhance security
- Set up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to monitor and defend against future attacks

By completing this project, you will help XYZ reinforce their perimeter security and prevent future breaches.
